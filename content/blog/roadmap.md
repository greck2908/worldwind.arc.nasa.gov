## WorldWind Roadmap 2018: Q2

---

Last December, we released [Web WorldWind 0.9.0](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WebWorldWind/releases/tag/v0.9.0),
giving the community a solid foundation for their applications. Since then, we've been working on bug fixes and new
features for the upcoming [Web WorldWind 0.10.0](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WebWorldWind/milestone/2) release. 
Here's a look at the WorldWind team's progress since 0.9.0, and the progress toward our goals for 2018 Q2:

*Please note this is a preliminary plan, so not all features may be included in our next release.*
