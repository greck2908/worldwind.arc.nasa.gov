### Power your browser

Web WorldWind is a free, open-source virtual globe for web pages. Written in JavaScript, Web WorldWind enables web page
and application builders to quickly create interactive visualizations of geographic information on an interactive 3D
globe or 2D map. Web WorldWind provides an API that enables JavaScript programs to control every detail of visualization
and interaction. Use it to embed a globe in your web page or create your own application. Web WorldWind runs on all
major operating systems, desktop and mobile devices, and web browsers.
